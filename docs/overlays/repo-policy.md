# Repo Policy — Consumer Overlay Template

> **File Version:** 2026-02-26

## Purpose

Declares the consumer repo's branch policy, PR rules, merge method, and naming conventions. Protocol gates reference this overlay for repo-specific workflow decisions.

## Overlay Review Gate

Before accepting this overlay into the consumer repo:

- Best next step? YES
- Confidence: 95

## Instructions

Copy into consumer repo at `<DOCS_ROOT>/overlays/repo-policy.md` and edit there.  
Do NOT edit this template inside the kit head — it will be overwritten on subtree pull.

## Branch Policy

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default branch | `main` (confirmed: `origin/HEAD -> origin/main`) |
| Feature branch pattern | `feature/<STORY-ID>-<short-description>` |
| Chore branch pattern | `chore/<short-description>` |
| Merge method | Fast-forward only (`--ff-only`), fall back to `--no-ff` if diverged |
| Delete branch after merge | Yes (local + remote) |

## PR Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Required reviewers | 0 (solo dev, no PR policy) |
| Required checks | None (no CI; local `npm run test` + `npm run build` before push) |
| Auto-merge allowed | N/A (direct push to main after local Green Gate) |
