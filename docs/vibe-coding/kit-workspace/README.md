## Consumer notice

This directory ships to consumer repos via subtree but is **not intended for consumer use**.
Consumer repos should ignore it. If doc-audit detects consumer-side references to
kit-internal planning files, it will emit a WARNING.

VIBE-KIT-SNAPSHOT.md is intentionally excluded from consumer distribution.

Kit-specific planning docs belong here. Consumer-specific docs belong in `<DOCS_ROOT>/`.
