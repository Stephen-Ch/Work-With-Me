# Vibe-Coding Protocol Migration Instructions

**Version:** v7.1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-05

## Purpose
Guide for migrating vibe-coding protocol v7 to other projects (new projects or upgrading from older protocol versions).

## Core Principle
The protocol is **project-agnostic** by design. Gates, sequencing rules, and enforcement mechanisms never change. Only project-specific context (hot files, routes, tech stack) requires customization.

---

## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Copy Core Bundle (Always Identical)

Copy these files/directories unchanged from source project:

```
docs/vibe-coding/protocol/
├── protocol-v7.md                    # Core rules (gates, sequencing, enforcement)
├── copilot-instructions-v7.md        # Copilot-specific protocol (CUSTOMIZE later)
├── required-artifacts.md             # Doc Audit rules (CUSTOMIZE examples)
├── alignment-mode.md                 # Alignment Mode workflow
├── verification-mode.md              # Verification Mode workflow
├── prompt-lifecycle.md               # State definitions (READY/IN-PROGRESS/etc)
├── stay-on-track.md                  # Cross-cutting coverage rules
├── working-agreement-v1.md           # 3-party sequencing rules
├── merge-prompt-template.md          # Merge/rollback template
└── templates/                        # Control Deck templates
    ├── VISION.template.md
    ├── EPICS.template.md
    └── NEXT.template.md

docs/Start-Here-For-AI.md             # Session bootstrap (CUSTOMIZE project name)
docs/vibe-coding/VIBE-CODING.VERSION.md   # Version tracking
.github/copilot-instructions.md       # Enforcer (points to protocol, CUSTOMIZE path)
```

### Phase 2: Run Project Assessment Prompt

Before customizing, run the diagnostic prompt below to identify what needs adaptation.

### Phase 3: Customize Project-Specific References

**A) Remove Rawls-specific references:**

Search and replace in copied files:
- File headers: `"— Rawls Game"` → `"— [Your Project Name]"`
- Route references: `src/app/app.routes.ts` → `[your routes file path]`
- Example content: Replace Rawls Game VISION/EPICS examples with placeholders

**B) Update copilot-instructions-v7.md:**

Lines 35-79 contain Rawls-specific context. Replace with your project's:

1. **Project Context** (architecture, tech stack, key patterns):
   ```markdown
   ## Project Context
   - Framework: [e.g., Angular 18, React 18, Next.js 14]
   - State management: [e.g., RxJS, Zustand, Redux]
   - Routing: [e.g., Angular Router, React Router, App Router]
   - Build system: [e.g., Vite, Webpack, Turbopack]
   - Test framework: [e.g., Karma+Jasmine, Jest+RTL, Vitest]
   ```

2. **Hot Files** (files >300 LOC or high churn):
   ```markdown
   ## [Project] Hot Files (Two-Path Rule)
   Files requiring analysis-first OR full-file replacement:
   - [path/to/router.ts] - routing config, 350 LOC
   - [path/to/store.ts] - global state, 400 LOC
   - [path/to/main-component.ts] - coordinator, 320 LOC
   ```

3. **Route Coverage Table Pattern** (cross-cutting changes):
   ```markdown
   - Route Coverage Table using [your project] routes from `[routes file path]`:
     | Route | Status | Evidence |
     | ----- | ------ | -------- |
     | [route1] | UPDATED / NO CHANGE REQUIRED | [reason] |
   ```

4. **Content/Build Pipeline** (if applicable):
   ```markdown
   - Content pipeline: [source files] → [build scripts] → [output artifacts]
   ```

**C) Update protocol-v7.md cross-cutting section:**

Line 234 references Rawls routes. Update with your project's route structure:
```markdown
For ANY cross-cutting change, your completion report MUST include a route coverage table using the actual [Project] routes from `[routes file path]`:
```

**D) Update required-artifacts.md examples:**

Lines 90-107 use Rawls Game as VISION.md example. Replace with generic examples or your project's actual purpose statement.

### Phase 4: Create Control Deck

**If migrating to NEW project (no existing docs):**

1. Copy templates to `docs/project/`:
   ```
   cp docs/vibe-coding/protocol/templates/VISION.template.md docs/project/VISION.md
   cp docs/vibe-coding/protocol/templates/EPICS.template.md docs/project/EPICS.md
   cp docs/vibe-coding/protocol/templates/NEXT.template.md docs/project/NEXT.md
   ```

2. Populate with actual content (work with product owner/Stephen to fill sections)

3. Verify Population Gate PASS:
   ```bash
   # Run placeholder scan
   grep -iE '(TBD|TODO|TEMPLATE|PLACEHOLDER|FILL IN|COMING SOON|XXX|FIXME|TO BE DETERMINED|<fill)' docs/project/VISION.md docs/project/EPICS.md docs/project/NEXT.md
   
   # Should return no matches (exit code 1 means PASS)
   ```

**If migrating to EXISTING project (has docs/project/):**

1. Verify existing VISION/EPICS/NEXT meet required-artifacts.md thresholds:
   - VISION.md sections >= 25 words each
   - EPICS.md descriptions >= 15 words with goals + success criteria
   - NEXT.md NEXT STEP >= 10 words, DoD >= 10 words, Done When items >= 6 words

2. If thresholds not met, expand content before running Doc Audit

### Phase 5: Update Enforcer

Edit `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to point to new protocol location:

```markdown
# Copilot Instructions — [Your Project] (Enforcer)

Before any work:
1) Read `docs/Start-Here-For-AI.md`
2) Follow `docs/vibe-coding/protocol/protocol-v7.md` + `docs/vibe-coding/protocol/copilot-instructions-v7.md`

Non-negotiables (every response):
1) Proof-of-Read (file + quote + "Applying: rule")
2) Prompt Review Gate (what / best next step YES/NO / confidence)
3) Stop on error (non-zero exit → stop, propose smallest fix, wait)
4) Green Gate for code prompts:
   - [your test command, e.g., npm test]
   - [your build command, e.g., npm run build]
```

### Phase 6: Run Initial Doc Audit

After migration complete, verify setup with Start-of-Session Doc Audit:

1. Open Copilot in new project
2. Paste: "Run Start-of-Session Doc Audit"
3. Verify PASS (all 5 checks green)
4. If FAIL, enter Alignment Mode to remediate

---

## Upgrading from Older Protocol Version

**If target project has vibe-coding v6.x or earlier:**

1. Archive old protocol:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/archive/deprecated/
   mv docs/vibe-coding/protocol docs/archive/deprecated/protocol-v6
   ```

2. Copy v7.1.0 bundle fresh (Phase 1 above)

3. Migrate any project-specific customizations from archived version:
   - Check old copilot-instructions for hot files list
   - Check old protocol for route coverage patterns
   - Preserve any working agreements specific to team

4. Update Control Deck if format changed (e.g., NEXT.md gained "Done When" section in v7)

5. Run Doc Audit to verify Population Gate with new thresholds

**Breaking changes v6 → v7:**
- Population Gate now requires word-count thresholds (not just "substantive content")
- 3-Party Approval Gate added (alignment-mode.md canonical)
- Prompt Review Gate now 4 lines (was 3 in some v6 variants)
- Command Lock sequencing clarified (reads allowed after gate, before Proof-of-Read)

---

## Project Assessment Diagnostic Prompt

Run this prompt in target project BEFORE migration to identify customization needs:

\`\`\`markdown
PROMPT-ID: VIBE-CODING-V7-PROJECT-ASSESSMENT-001

GOAL: Diagnose project-specific context needed for vibe-coding v7 migration

SCOPE:
- Read codebase structure to identify hot files (>300 LOC, routing/state/coordination)
- Read routing config to identify cross-cutting coverage requirements
- Read package.json + test/build config to identify tech stack
- Read existing docs/project/ (if exists) to assess Control Deck population
- Output assessment report with customization checklist

TASKS:
A) Identify framework + tech stack from package.json dependencies
B) Locate routing configuration file (search for app.routes.ts, routes.tsx, app/\*\*/route.ts patterns)
C) Identify hot files (>300 LOC in src/) focusing on:
   - Routing/navigation coordinators
   - Global state management
   - Main layout/shell components
   - Content pipeline build scripts
D) Check if docs/project/ exists:
   - If YES: read VISION/EPICS/NEXT and assess word counts vs v7 thresholds
   - If NO: note Control Deck creation required
E) Identify cross-cutting patterns (search src/ for shared CSS vars, component libraries, copy dictionaries)
F) Output assessment report with:
   - Framework/stack summary
   - Routes file path + route list
   - Hot files list (path + LOC + purpose)
   - Control Deck status (exists/needs-creation/needs-expansion)
   - Cross-cutting patterns requiring coverage tables
   - Customization checklist (what to update in copilot-instructions-v7.md + protocol-v7.md)

# END PROMPT
\`\`\`

**Assessment Report Format:**

\`\`\`markdown
# Vibe-Coding v7 Migration Assessment — [Project Name]

## Tech Stack
- Framework: [name + version]
- State: [management approach]
- Routing: [library + config file path]
- Build: [tool + commands]
- Tests: [framework + command]

## Hot Files (Candidates for Two-Path Rule)
| File | LOC | Purpose | Churn Risk |
|------|-----|---------|-----------|
| [path] | [count] | [description] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] |

## Routing Structure
Routes file: `[path to routes config]`

Routes requiring cross-cutting coverage:
- [route1]
- [route2]
...

## Control Deck Status
- `docs/project/VISION.md`: [EXISTS (meets thresholds) / EXISTS (needs expansion) / MISSING]
- `docs/project/EPICS.md`: [EXISTS / MISSING]
- `docs/project/NEXT.md`: [EXISTS / MISSING]

Population Gate blockers:
- [list any sections below word-count thresholds or containing placeholders]

## Cross-Cutting Patterns
Patterns requiring route coverage tables:
- [e.g., Shared CSS variables in styles/theme.scss]
- [e.g., UI component library in src/components/shared]
- [e.g., Copy dictionary in src/i18n/en.json]

## Customization Checklist

### copilot-instructions-v7.md
- [ ] Update Project Context (lines 35-40): replace Rawls framework/stack with [your stack]
- [ ] Update Hot Files list (lines 47-55): replace with hot files table above
- [ ] Update Route Coverage Table pattern (lines 69-75): replace with routes from [routes file]
- [ ] Update Content Pipeline section (if applicable): [describe your pipeline or remove]

### protocol-v7.md
- [ ] Update cross-cutting route reference (line 234): replace `src/app/app.routes.ts` with `[your routes file]`
- [ ] Update file header (line 1): "— Rawls Game" → "— [Your Project]"

### required-artifacts.md
- [ ] Update VISION.md examples (lines 90-107): replace Rawls Game examples with [your project purpose] or generic placeholders

### Start-Here-For-AI.md
- [ ] Update project name references

### Control Deck (docs/project/)
- [ ] [Create VISION/EPICS/NEXT from templates OR expand existing to meet thresholds]

## Migration Readiness
- **Ready to migrate?** [YES (all customization identified) / NO (blockers below)]
- **Blockers:** [list any missing info or decisions needed]
\`\`\`

## Key Invariants (Never Change Across Projects)

These elements are **project-agnostic** and must remain identical:

### Gates
- Prompt Review Gate format (4 lines: What, Best next step, Confidence, Work state)
- Vision & User Story Gate requirements (Story ID, NEXT STEP citation)
- Proof-of-Read format (file + quote + "Applying: rule")
- Population Gate thresholds (word counts: 25/10/6)
- 3-Party Approval Gate checklist structure

### Sequencing
- Command Lock (no terminal/edits/searches before Prompt Review Gate)
- Session flow (Prompt Review Gate → Proof-of-Read → Doc Audit → work)
- Doc Audit rerun triggers (Control Deck changes since last audit)

### Prompt Classes
- FORMAL WORK PROMPT (requires PROMPT-ID, allows execution)
- CONVERSATIONAL REQUEST (no PROMPT-ID, read-only tools only)

### State Definitions
- READY, IN-PROGRESS, COMPLETE, MERGED, OBSOLETE (from prompt-lifecycle.md)

### Enforcement Rules
- Green Gate (tests + build before commit)
- Hot File Protocol (analysis-first OR full-file replacement)
- Cross-cutting coverage (route table required)
- Scope discipline (stay inside SCOPE GUARDRAILS)

---

## Tunables (Customize Per Project)

These elements **must be adapted** to each project:

### Context
- Project name (file headers)
- Framework/tech stack (copilot-instructions)
- Architecture patterns (copilot-instructions)

### Hot Files
- List of files >300 LOC or high churn
- Routing coordinators
- State management files
- Main layout components

### Routes
- Routes file path
- Route list for coverage tables
- Parameterized route patterns

### Cross-Cutting Patterns
- Shared component libraries
- CSS variable systems
- Copy dictionaries
- Build pipeline artifacts

### Control Deck Content
- VISION.md (product purpose, unique to each project)
- EPICS.md (feature roadmap, unique to each project)
- NEXT.md (current story, unique to each project)

---

## Common Migration Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting to update copilot-instructions hot files** → AI doesn't know which files need analysis-first
2. **Leaving Rawls routes in protocol-v7.md** → cross-cutting coverage tables show wrong routes
3. **Copying Control Deck templates without populating** → Doc Audit FAIL on placeholders
4. **Not running assessment prompt first** → miss project-specific patterns requiring coverage
5. **Changing gate formats** → breaks enforcement consistency across projects
6. **Updating thresholds per project** → Population Gate becomes subjective

---

## Support

For migration questions or protocol issues:
1. Check protocol-reassessment-post-sweep-2026-01-05.md for known gaps
2. Run assessment prompt to diagnose customization needs
3. Verify Control Deck population before first Doc Audit
